At <a href="https://2022.ecvp.eu/">ECVP2022</a>, I joined a symposium on population receptive fields to give a talk on the neuronal basis and potnetial use of population receptive fields in non-human primates. The talk was partially based on our <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67304">eLife paper</a>, but I also included some preliminary new data.

I also presented a poster on our recent electrophysiology work that demonstrates a neural process of 'Pop-in', the rapid inversion of pop-out 
from enhancement to suppression to protect visual search from salient distractors.

RESEARCH INTERESTS

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the neural mechanisms of perception and cognition. I have worked on a range of topics including visual rivalry, motion perception, object recognition, attention, multimodal integration, plasticity, decision making, stereopsis, working memory, reward processing and basic neural coding problems using psychophysical, computational, neurophysiological and neuro-imaging methods.



More recently, I have started combining deep brain stimulation with functional neuro-imaging to study reward-processing, executive function and the neural nature of reward-based psychiatric disorders with the aim to improve deep brain stimulation treatment of these disorders. This project, which is a collaboration between the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, the Department of Psychiatry of the Academic Medical Center and the Department of Neurophysiology of KU Leuven, is funded by a VENI grant from NWO.

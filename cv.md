## Research interests
I am (systems) neuroscientist with an interest in the neural mechanisms of perception and cognition. 
How does the brain process information and what mechanisms give rise to flexible, goal-directed behavior? 
How can we get a grip on these processes and improve life? I have worked on a range of topics including visual perception, 
attention, multimodal integration, neural plasticity, decision-making, working memory, reward processing and basic neural 
coding problems using behavioral, computational, neurophysiological and neuroimaging methods in non-human primates, humans, & rodents. 

Currently, I am working on a project in which we combine (deep) brain stimulation, functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological 
recordings in non-human primates to investigate the dynamic neural networks underlying vision, reward-processing and executive functions.

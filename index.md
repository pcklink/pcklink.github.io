### [New paper]: The future og NHP-MRI
<a href="https://cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)31089-X#.Xk1ypb_Il6Y.twitter"><img alt="AoN" src="https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/d065719b-dfe8-4ce7-83c8-822825f38526/cov200h.gif" width="30" align="left"></a> 
Another piece by our [PRIME-DE consortium](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/indiPRIME.html) came out in Neuron (open access): *Accelerating the Evolution of Nonhuman Primate Neuroimaging*. It is the result of a eeting held at the Wellcome Trust in London last September and presents a collaborative vision for how to move the field of NHP neuroimaging forward The future is collaborative!

### [New resource]: RheMAP
<a href="https://github.com/PRIME-RE/RheMAP"><img alt="AoN" src="https://github.com/PRIME-RE/RheMAP/raw/master/images/RegisterTemplates.png" width="30" align="left"></a> 
We recently created a tool to easily register non-human primate neuroimaging data from one standard space to another. We called it *RheMAP* and made both the data and underlying code freely available on [Zenodo](https://lnkd.in/d7pCjFE) and [GitHub](https://lnkd.in/dMpeD_Y). Check it out if you think this might be useful! Here's a [Twitter thread about it](https://twitter.com/ChrizKlink/status/1229883840023465985?s=20)
